Instructions:

You are the zombie, and the dice are the humans you want to eat.
On your turn, you will roll 3 dice drawn randomly from the bag.

     BRAINS   are humans that you caught.
     SHOTS    are humans that shot you.
     RUNNERS  are humans that got away.

The color of the dice indicate how many brains, shots, and runners
there are on them.

     GREEN   dice have 3 brains, 2 runners, and 1 shot.
     YELLOW  dice have 2 of each.
     RED     dice have 1 brain, 2 runners, and 3 shots.
<break>
If you decide to keep rolling, any brains and shots you rolled will
be set aside. Any runners you rolled will have to be rolled again.
So keep the color of the runners in mind before you decide to
press your luck and roll again.

You can always choose 'PEEK' in order to see what color dice
are still in the bag.

All players take turns. You can end your turn one of 2 ways:

    1. If you decide to BANK, any brains you have go onto the
       scoreboard and play passes to the next player.

    2. If you press your luck too much and get 3 or more shots
       then your turn ends, and you lose all the brains you
       rolled this turn.
       Whatever you banked in previous rolls, though, is safe.
<break>
The first player to reach or exceed 13 brains on their turn puts the
game into its final phase. Every other player gets one last chance to try
to be the winner.
